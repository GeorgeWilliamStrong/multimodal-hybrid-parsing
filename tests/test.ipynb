However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\\n\\n## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\\n\\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and  may  designate  these  instruments  as  cash  flow  hedges.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its  forecasted  foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\\n\\nTo protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 29, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.\\n\\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\", \"## Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nTo protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\\n\\n## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\\n\\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes  any  gain  on  these  sales  as  a  reduction  of  products  cost  of  sales  when  the  related  final  products  are  sold  by  the Company. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables,  which  accounted  for  46%  and  18%.  As  of  September  30,  2023,  the  Company  had  two  vendors  that  individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.\\n\\n## Note 5 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\\n\\nThe  following  table  shows  the  Company's  condensed  consolidated  financial  statement  details  as  of  June  29,  2024  and September 30, 2023 (in millions):\\n\\n## Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\\n\\n|                                          | June 29, 2024   | September 30, 2023   |\\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\\n| Gross property, plant and equipment      | $ 117,129       | $ 114,599            |\\n| Accumulated depreciation                 | (72,627)        | (70,884)             |\\n| Total property, plant and equipment, net | $ 44,502        | $ 43,715             |\", \"## Note 6 - Income Taxes\\n\\n## European Commission State Aid Decision\\n\\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission (the 'Commission') announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the 'State Aid Decision'). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the 'General Court'). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice (the 'ECJ') and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.\\n\\n## Note 7 - Debt\\n\\n## Commercial Paper\\n\\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\n\\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ('Form 10-Q') contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company's business and results of operations are forward-looking statements  Forward-looking statements can . also  be  identified  by  words  such  as  'future,'  'anticipates,'  'believes,'  'estimates,'  'expects,'  'intends,'  'plans,'  'predicts,'  'will,' 'would,'  'could,'  'can,'  'may,'  and  similar  terms.  Forward-looking  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  future  performance  and  the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading 'Risk Factors.' The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\n\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\n\\nThe  following  discussion  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  2023  Form  10-K  filed  with  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\n\\n## Available Information\\n\\nThe  Company  periodically  provides  certain  information  for  investors  on  its  corporate  website,  www.apple.com,  and  its  investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on  environmental,  social  and  governance  matters,  and  details  related  to  the  Company's  annual  meeting  of  shareholders.  The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\n\\n## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\\n\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:\\n\\n    - · iPad Air ; ®\\n    - · iPad Pro ; ®\\n    - · iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, iPadOS 18, watchOS 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS 18. ® ® ® ®\\n\\nThe  Company  also  announced Apple  Intelligence™,  a  personal  intelligence  system  that  uses  generative  models,  which  will  be available on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, macOS Sequoia and iPadOS 18.\\n\\n## Fiscal Period\\n\\nThe Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.

Legal Proceedings\\n\\n## Digital Markets Act Investigations\\n\\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union ('EU') Digital Markets Act (the 'DMA'). The Commission's investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary  findings  in  the Article  5(4)  investigation  alleging  that  the  Company's App  Store  rules  are  in  breach  of  the  DMA  and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company's new contractual requirements  for  third-party  app  developers  and  app  marketplaces  may  violate  the  DMA.  If  the  Commission  makes  a  final determination  that  there  has  been  a  violation,  it  can  issue  a  cease  and  desist  order  and  may  impose  fines  up  to  10%  of  the Company's annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the  effectiveness  of  the  Commission's  order  would  apply  immediately  while  the  appeal  is  pending,  unless  a  stay  of  the  order  is granted.  The  Company  believes  that  it  complies  with  the  DMA  and  has  continued  to  make  changes  to  its  compliance  plan  in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\\n\\n## Department of Justice Lawsuit\\n\\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'DOJ') and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in  the  markets  for  'performance  smartphones'  and  'smartphones'  in  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws. The  DOJ  is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state  and  federal  courts  in  the  U.S.  alleging  similar  violations  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws  and  seeking  monetary  damages  and  other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\\n\\n## Epic Games\\n\\nEpic Games, Inc. ('Epic') filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'California District Court') against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Store Review Guidelines violate California's unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the  Company's compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\\n\\n## Other Legal Proceedings\\n\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\n\\n## Item 1A.    Risk Factors\\n\\nThe  Company's  business,  reputation,  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  stock  price  can  be  affected  by  a  number  of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2024 (the 'second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q'), in each case under the heading 'Risk Factors.'
