      "## Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.\n",

      "## 1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "How can we perform efficient approximate inference and learning with directed probabilistic models whose continuous latent variables and/or parameters have intractable posterior distributions? The variational Bayesian (VB) approach involves the optimization of an approximation to the intractable posterior. Unfortunately, the common mean-field approach requires analytical solutions of expectations w.r.t. the approximate posterior, which are also intractable in the general case. We show how a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a simple differentiable unbiased estimator of the lower bound; this SGVB (Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes) estimator can be used for efficient approximate posterior inference in almost any model with continuous latent variables and/or parameters, and is straightforward to optimize using standard stochastic gradient ascent techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the case of an i.i.d. dataset and continuous latent variables per datapoint, we propose the Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB) algorithm. In the AEVB algorithm, we make inference and learning especially efficient by using the SGVB estimator to optimize a recognition model that allows us to perform very efficient approximate posterior inference using simple ancestral sampling, which in turn allows us to efficiently learn the model parameters, without the need of expensive iterative inference schemes (such as MCMC) per datapoint. The learned approximate posterior inference model can also be used for a host of tasks such as recognition, denoising, representation, and visualization purposes. When a neural network is used for the recognition model, we arrive at the variational auto-encoder.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2 Method\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategy in this section can be used to derive a lower bound estimator (a stochastic objective function) for a variety of directed graphical models with continuous latent variables. We will restrict ourselves here to the common case where we have an i.i.d. dataset with latent variables per datapoint, and where we like to perform maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference on the (global) parameters, and variational inference on the latent variables. It is, for example,\n",

Solid lines denote the generative model \\( p_\\theta(z)p_\\theta(x|z) \\), dashed lines denote the variational approximation \\( q_\\phi(z|x) \\) to the intractable posterior \\( p_\\theta(z|x) \\). The variational parameters \\( \\phi \\) are learned jointly with the generative model parameters \\( \\theta \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "straightforward to extend this scenario to the case where we also perform variational inference on the global parameters; that algorithm is put in the appendix, but experiments with that case are left to future work. Note that our method can be applied to online, non-stationary settings, e.g. streaming data, but here we assume a fixed dataset for simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2.1 Problem scenario\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us consider some dataset \\( X = \\{ x^{(i)} \\}_{i=1}^N \\) consisting of \\( N \\) i.i.d. samples of some continuous or discrete variable \\( x \\). We assume that the data are generated by some random process, involving an unobserved continuous random variable \\( z \\). The process consists of two steps: (1) a value \\( z^{(i)} \\) is generated from some prior distribution \\( p_\\theta^*(z) \\); (2) a value \\( x^{(i)} \\) is generated from some conditional distribution \\( p_\\theta^*(x|z) \\). We assume that the prior \\( p_\\theta^*(z) \\) and likelihood \\( p_\\theta^*(x|z) \\) come from parametric families of distributions \\( p_\\theta(z) \\) and \\( p_\\theta(x|z) \\), and that their PDFs are differentiable almost everywhere w.r.t. both \\( \\theta \\) and \\( z \\). Unfortunately, a lot of this process is hidden from our view: the true parameters \\( \\theta^* \\) as well as the values of the latent variables \\( z^{(i)} \\) are unknown to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very importantly, we do not make the common simplifying assumptions about the marginal or posterior probabilities. Conversely, we are here interested in a general algorithm that even works efficiently in the case of:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Intractability**: the case where the integral of the marginal likelihood \\( p_\\theta(x) = \\int p_\\theta(z)p_\\theta(x|z) dz \\) is intractable (so we cannot evaluate or differentiate the marginal likelihood), where the true posterior density \\( p_\\theta(z|x) = \\frac{p_\\theta(x|z)p_\\theta(z)}{p_\\theta(x)} \\) is intractable (so the EM algorithm cannot be used), and where the required integrals for any reasonable mean-field VB algorithm are also intractable. These intractabilities are quite common and appear in cases of moderately complicated likelihood functions \\( p_\\theta(x|z) \\), e.g. a neural network with a nonlinear hidden layer.\n",
      "2. **A large dataset**: we have so much data that batch optimization is too costly; we would like to make parameter updates using small minibatches or even single datapoints. Sampling-based solutions, e.g. Monte Carlo EM, would in general be too slow, since it involves a typically expensive sampling loop per datapoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are interested in, and propose a solution to, three related problems in the above scenario:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Efficient approximate ML or MAP estimation for the parameters \\( \\theta \\). The parameters can be of interest themselves, e.g. if we are analyzing some natural process. They also allow us to mimic the hidden random process and generate artificial data that resembles the real data.\n",
      "2. Efficient approximate posterior inference of the latent variable \\( z \\) given an observed value \\( x \\) for a choice of parameters \\( \\theta \\). This is useful for coding or data representation tasks.\n",
      "3. Efficient approximate marginal inference of the variable \\( x \\). This allows us to perform all kinds of inference tasks where a prior over \\( x \\) is required. Common applications in computer vision include image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purpose of solving the above problems, let us introduce a recognition model \\( q_\\phi(z|x) \\): an approximation to the intractable true posterior \\( p_\\theta(z|x) \\). Note that in contrast with the approximate posterior in mean-field variational inference, it is not necessarily factorial and its parameters \\( \\phi \\) are not computed from some closed-form expectation. Instead, we'll introduce a method for learning the recognition model parameters \\( \\phi \\) jointly with the generative model parameters \\( \\theta \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "From a coding theory perspective, the unobserved variables \\( z \\) have an interpretation as a latent representation or code. In this paper, we will therefore also refer to the recognition model \\( q_\\phi(z|x) \\) as a probabilistic encoder, since given a datapoint \\( x \\), it produces a distribution (e.g. a Gaussian) over the possible values of the code \\( z \\) from which the datapoint \\( x \\) could have been generated. In a similar vein, we will refer to \\( p_\\theta(x|z) \\) as a probabilistic decoder, since given a code \\( z \\), it produces a distribution over the possible corresponding values of \\( x \\).\n",

      "The wake-sleep algorithm [HDFN95] is, to the best of our knowledge, the only other on-line learning method in the literature that is applicable to the same general class of continuous latent variable models. Like our method, the wake-sleep algorithm employs a recognition model that approximates the true posterior. A drawback of the wake-sleep algorithm is that it requires a concurrent optimization of two objective functions, which together do not correspond to optimization of (a bound of) the marginal likelihood. An advantage of wake-sleep is that it also applies to models with discrete latent variables. Wake-Sleep has the same computational complexity as AEVB per datapoint.\n",

      "Stochastic variational inference [HBWP13] has recently received increasing interest. Recently, [BJP12] introduced a control variate scheme to reduce the high variance of the naïve gradient estimator discussed in section 2.1, and applied to exponential family approximations of the posterior. In [RGB13], some general methods, i.e. a control variate scheme, were introduced for reducing the variance of the original gradient estimator. In [SK13], a similar reparameterization as in this paper was used in an efficient version of a stochastic variational inference algorithm for learning the natural parameters of exponential-family approximating distributions.\n",

      "The AEVB algorithm exposes a connection between directed probabilistic models (trained with a variational objective) and auto-encoders. A connection between linear auto-encoders and a certain class of generative linear-Gaussian models has long been known. In [Row98], it was shown that PCA corresponds to the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution of a special case of the linear-Gaussian model with a prior \\( p(z) = N(0, I) \\) and a conditional distribution \\( p(x|z) = N(x; Wz, \\epsilon I) \\), specifically the case with infinitesimally small \\( \\epsilon \\).\n",

      "In relevant recent work on autoencoders [VLL+10], it was shown that the training criterion of regularized autoencoders corresponds to maximization of a lower bound (see the infomax principle [Lin89]) of the mutual information between input \\( X \\) and latent representation \\( Z \\). Maximizing (w.r.t. parameters) the mutual information is equivalent to maximizing the conditional entropy, which is lower bounded by the expected loglikelihood of the data under the autoencoding model [VLL+10], i.e. the negative reconstruction error. However, it is well known that this reconstruction criterion is in itself not sufficient for learning useful representations [BCV13]. Regularization techniques have been proposed to make autoencoders learn useful representations, such as denoising, contractive, and sparse autoencoder variants [BCV13]. The SGVB objective contains a regularization term dictated by the variational bound (e.g. eq. (10)), lacking the usual nuisance regularization hyperparameter required to learn useful representations. Related are also encoder-decoder architectures such as the predictive sparse decomposition (PSD) [KRL08], from which we drew some inspiration. Also relevant are the recently introduced Generative Stochastic Networks [BTL13] where noisy auto-encoders learn the transition operator of a Markov chain that samples from the data distribution. In [SL10], a recognition model was employed for efficient learning with Deep Boltzmann Machines. These methods are targeted at either unnormalized models (i.e. undirected models like Boltzmann machines) or limited to sparse coding models, in contrast to our proposed algorithm for learning a general class of directed probabilistic models.\n",

Their work was developed independently of ours and provides an additional perspective on AEVB.\n",

Stepsizes were adapted with Adagrad [DHS10]; the Adagrad global stepsize parameters were chosen from {0.01, 0.02, 0.1} based on performance on the training set in the first few iterations.

The chosen number of hidden units is based on prior literature on auto-encoders, and the relative performance of different algorithms was not very sensitive to these choices. Figure 2 shows the results when comparing the lower bounds.

      "We have introduced a novel estimator of the variational lower bound, Stochastic Gradient VB (SGVB), for efficient approximate inference with continuous latent variables. The proposed estimator can be straightforwardly differentiated and optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. For the case of i.i.d. datasets and continuous latent variables per datapoint, we introduce an efficient algorithm for efficient inference and learning, Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB), that learns an approximate inference model using the SGVB estimator. The theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.\n",
