## Foreword: Your journey to a GenAI future

By Marinela Pro/uniFB01, Strategic AI Advisor at SAS

The advent of generative AI (GenAI) promises to revolutionize the landscape of human and business productivity. As you embark on this transformative journey, it is imperative to acknowledge the boundless potential of this new technology, as well as the challenges that accompany such innovation.

This report is based on a new survey of 1,600 organizations across the globe. The respondents are decision makers in GenAI strategy or data analytics in organizations across key sectors. The research assesses their current plans to deploy GenAI, reveals how the technology is integrated into their strategic planning, and explores the speci/uniFB01c issues they have encountered along the way. Through meticulous analysis, we examine the pulse of the market, offering insights into the prevailing sentiments around GenAI and the hurdles that organizations face as they integrate the technology into their operations.

From discussions on orchestration, governance and data privacy to consideration of hallucinations (incorrect or misleading results sometimes generated by large language models (LLMs)) and cost implications, we examine the challenges that companies must overcome and the opportunities GenAI offers for increased productivity and competitive advantage.

## Organizations are reporting early successes

Since the widespread launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, GenAI has emerged as a technology with extraordinary potential. Decision makers recognize that GenAI can drive innovation, new conversational experiences and operational ef/uniFB01ciency.

Our research shows that organizations that embrace GenAI are seeing signi/uniFB01cant bene/uniFB01ts.

<!-- image -->
**Image Description:** In this image we can see three different pictures. In the first picture we can see the text "report improved employee experience" and in the second picture we can see the text "say that they are making savings on operational costs". In the third picture we can see the text "state that customer retention is higher" and in the fourth picture we can see the text "employee experience is improving".
<!-- end image description -->


However, with increased focus on and investment in GenAI, many organizations are encountering dif/uniFB01culties with implementation. These issues threaten to waste resources, dissuade customers and even render organizations legally noncompliant. In organizations that have fully implemented GenAI projects, 39% are /uniFB01nding it a challenge to integrate GenAI technology into existing systems, while 34% are struggling with prohibitive costs. These issues are best resolved at an early stage, ideally before GenAI is deployed and signi/uniFB01cant resources are invested.

Our research shows that while organizations expect to have GenAI successes, they hit stumbling blocks in four areas of implementation:

    - · Increasing trust in data usage and achieving compliance. Embedding trust in your business outcomes.
    - · Unlocking value. Translating adoption into measurable bene/uniFB01ts.
    - · Orchestrating GenAI into existing systems and processes. Ensuring that systems and tools do not limit GenAI's potential.
    - · Finding talent and skills. Identifying the talent who can support your GenAI strategy.

## Strategies for successful GenAI implementation

There are four key elements to achieving success with your GenAI investment:

        - 1. Comprehensive governance
        - 2. Strategic deployment
        - 3. Technological integration
        - 4. Expert guidance

To maximize productivity, GenAI must be seamlessly embedded within business processes and systems. Performance should be reliable, transparent and ethical, accelerating productivity and improving customer experience, while adding measurable value to stakeholders.

## a. Comprehensive governance: Increasing trust in data usage and

## achieving regulatory compliance

When a GenAI investment performs reliably, transparently and ethically, organizations see the bene/uniFB01ts. However, many lack full oversight of the technology, and the majority are at risk of noncompliance when it comes to quickly evolving regulations.

## Our research /uniFB01nds that:

            - ·   Only one in 10 organizations has undergone the preparation needed to comply with GenAI regulations.
            - · 95% of businesses lack a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI.
            - ·   Fewer than one in 10 organizations (7%) is providing a high level of training on GenAI governance and monitoring.
            - ·   Three-quarters of respondents are concerned about data privacy (76%) and security (75%) when GenAI is used in their organization.
            - ·   Only one in 20 organizations (5%) has a reliable system in place to measure bias and privacy risk in LLMs.
            - ·   Seven in 10 organizations are not able to continuously monitor their GenAI systems.

Respondents who say they are best prepared for GenAI regulations are found in China (where almost a /uniFB01fth of respondents, 19% , report that they are fully prepared) followed by Australia (15%) and the US (14%) . The least prepared respondents are in Ireland, where 60% report they are prepared or only slightly prepared, and in Benelux (56%) and Poland (55%) .

Some sectors are ahead of the rest when it comes to developing a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI. Leading the way, telco organizations report that almost one in 10 (9%) have developed such a framework, followed by manufacturing organizations and retail, each at 8% .

Across all organizations, GenAI use can create anxieties about data privacy, security, lack of governance, dependence on the technology and its potential for amplifying bias.

Many of these organizations have not fully prepared themselves to comply with regulations and do not have GenAI governance in place or ways to monitor the technology.

Our research shows that businesses are rushing into GenAI before establishing adequate systems of governance, which could result in serious issues with quality and compliance later.

## b. Strategic deployment: Translating implementation into measurable bene/uniFB01ts

The ideal GenAI investment offers clear opportunities for ef/uniFB01ciency and a better customer experience, but many organizations report gaps in strategic thinking that are affecting successful rollout:

                        - ·   Nine in 10 senior tech decision makers (93%) admit that they do not fully understand GenAI or its potential impact on business processes.
                        - ·   Almost half (47%) are encountering challenges in transitioning from concept to practical use of GenAI.
                        - ·   More than a third (37%) foresee dif/uniFB01culty proving that GenAI offers a strong ROI or have found this hard to prove.
                        - ·   Fewer than half (45%) of CIOs and around a third (36%) of CTOs consider themselves extremely familiar with GenAI adoption in their organizations.
                        - ·   Four in 10 organizations (39%) do not have a GenAI usage policy in place for their staff.

The countries that we surveyed show a wide range of responses in terms of their GenAI strategy. Those who report that they face the most challenges transitioning the technology from concept to practical use include Spain (where 67% of respondents say this is a challenge) and Poland (64%), while the countries who are most con/uniFB01dent doing so include Canada (39%), Mexico (40%) and France (40%). Looking at regional trends, 71% of APAC companies are managing their GenAI usage with an internal policy, in contrast to 52% of LATAM respondents.

Respondents in manufacturing (where 61% have a good or complete understanding), life sciences (55%) and telco (55%) report the highest levels of personal understanding where GenAI is concerned. Respondents in the public sector are much less con/uniFB01dent in their understanding of GenAI (only 38% say they understand it well or completely).

Nine in 10 (93%) senior tech decision makers admit not fully understanding GenAI and its potential impacts on business processes.

Please note that percentages on charts may not add to 100% due to rounding

LLMs alone do not solve business problems. GenAI is nothing more than a feature that can augment your existing processes, but you need tools that enable their integration, governance and orchestration. And most importantly, you need people that can use tools to ensure the appropriate level of orchestration.' '

Marinela Pro/uniFB01,

Strategic AI Advisor at SAS

## Insight 5:

Make sure that your GenAI software vendors can integrate with existing work/uniFB02ow and decisioning platforms.

GenAI is an ideal contributor to hyper-automation, which facilitates the automation of all feasible tasks within an organization. It excels in summarizing vast amounts of data to support decisioning work/uniFB02ows, enabling real-time interactions aligned with your preferred business processes.

**Image Description:** In this image we can see some blue shapes.
<!-- end image description -->


## Insight 6:

Using a decisioning work/uniFB02ow system to infuse GenAI into existing business processes facilitates measurable outcomes.

LLMs can only execute a few tasks of a use case. Organizations still need an end-to-end process that orchestrates the AI life cycle while enhancing the transparency and governance of LLMs.

## d. Expert guidance: Resourcing challenges with scarcity of GenAI skill sets

## Blueprint for gaining a competitive advantage

It is crucial that GenAI projects are built in a way that not only meet current needs but are also prepared for future growth and innovation.

For a successful GenAI program, you should have a clear strategy for each of the following areas:

                                        - · Accelerated innovation. Seamlessly integrate GenAI models into decisioning work/uniFB02ows, AI and machine learning applications, and existing business processes by using decisioning /uniFB02ow tools such as intelligent decisioning.
                                        - · Data protection. Ensure user privacy and security with robust data quality measures - including synthetic data generation, data minimization, anonymization and encryption - that provide sensitive information safeguards.
                                        - · Trustworthy and explainable results. Data experts can apply natural language processing techniques to preprocess data, explain the generated output in easily understandable terms, minimize hallucinations and reduce token costs.
                                        - · Enhanced governance. Use built-in work/uniFB02ows that validate the entire life cycle of LLMs, from regulatory compliance to model risk management.

As organizations continue to experiment with GenAI, real business value will come down to identifying real-world use cases that deliver trusted and scalable value.

As one of the data and AI companies with the longest experience in the /uniFB01eld, SAS is equipped to be the trusted partner that helps organizations con/uniFB01dently succeed in the GenAI journey across different industries, regulatory scenarios and application areas.

At SAS, we focus on identifying high-ROI, ethically applied use cases. Our goal is to enable secure adoption, boost productivity, produce trusted results, and accelerate innovation across diverse industries and regulatory landscapes.

**Image Description:** The image is a graphic with a blue background. It is a simple, flat design with a white outline. The design is made up of a series of interconnected lines and curves, creating a sense of movement and flow. The lines are thin and delicate, and they seem to be drawn with a brush or pen, giving the impression of a fluid, flowing motion.

The lines are arranged in a way that suggests a continuous flow, with each line intersecting and touching the next. This creates a sense of depth and complexity, as if the lines are moving from one point to another. The overall effect is one of fluidity and grace, as if the lines are moving in a natural, organic way.

The design is simple yet effective, with a focus on the lines and curves rather than the shapes themselves. This simplicity allows the viewer to focus on the flow of the lines, which is the key element of the graphic.

The image is likely intended to evoke a sense of movement or flow, as if the lines are moving from one point to another. This can be achieved by using a sense of motion, such as a wave or a ripple, to create a sense of energy or fluidity.

In summary, the image is a simple yet effective graphic with a fluid, flowing motion, and a sense of movement. The lines are delicate and delicate, and they create a sense of fluidity and grace. The overall effect is one of movement and flow, with a sense of movement or flow that is both natural and deliberate.
