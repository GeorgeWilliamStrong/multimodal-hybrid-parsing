## Foreword: Your journey to a GenAI future

By Marinela Pro/uniFB01, Strategic AI Advisor at SAS

The advent of generative AI (GenAI) promises to revolutionize the landscape of human and business productivity. As you embark on this transformative journey, it is imperative to acknowledge the boundless potential of this new technology, as well as the challenges that accompany such innovation.

This report is based on a new survey of 1,600 organizations across the globe. The respondents are decision makers in GenAI strategy or data analytics in organizations across key sectors. The research assesses their current plans to deploy GenAI, reveals how the technology is integrated into their strategic planning, and explores the speci/uniFB01c issues they have encountered along the way. Through meticulous analysis, we examine the pulse of the market, offering insights into the prevailing sentiments around GenAI and the hurdles that organizations face as they integrate the technology into their operations.

From discussions on orchestration, governance and data privacy to consideration of hallucinations (incorrect or misleading results sometimes generated by large language models (LLMs)) and cost implications, we examine the challenges that companies must overcome and the opportunities GenAI offers for increased productivity and competitive advantage.

## Organizations are reporting early successes

Since the widespread launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, GenAI has emerged as a technology with extraordinary potential. Decision makers recognize that GenAI can drive innovation, new conversational experiences and operational ef/uniFB01ciency.

Our research shows that organizations that embrace GenAI are seeing signi/uniFB01cant bene/uniFB01ts.

<!-- image -->
**AI-Generated Image Description:** In the first image, 89% of employees say they are satisfied with their job performance. 82% of making savings on operational costs say they are satisfied.
<!-- end image description -->


However, with increased focus on and investment in GenAI, many organizations are encountering dif/uniFB01culties with implementation. These issues threaten to waste resources, dissuade customers and even render organizations legally noncompliant. In organizations that have fully implemented GenAI projects, 39% are /uniFB01nding it a challenge to integrate GenAI technology into existing systems, while 34% are struggling with prohibitive costs. These issues are best resolved at an early stage, ideally before GenAI is deployed and signi/uniFB01cant resources are invested.

Our research shows that while organizations expect to have GenAI successes, they hit stumbling blocks in four areas of implementation:

    - · Increasing trust in data usage and achieving compliance. Embedding trust in your business outcomes.
    - · Unlocking value. Translating adoption into measurable bene/uniFB01ts.
    - · Orchestrating GenAI into existing systems and processes. Ensuring that systems and tools do not limit GenAI's potential.
    - · Finding talent and skills. Identifying the talent who can support your GenAI strategy.

## Strategies for successful GenAI implementation

There are four key elements to achieving success with your GenAI investment:

        - 1. Comprehensive governance
        - 2. Strategic deployment
        - 3. Technological integration
        - 4. Expert guidance

To maximize productivity, GenAI must be seamlessly embedded within business processes and systems. Performance should be reliable, transparent and ethical, accelerating productivity and improving customer experience, while adding measurable value to stakeholders.

## a. Comprehensive governance: Increasing trust in data usage and

## achieving regulatory compliance

When a GenAI investment performs reliably, transparently and ethically, organizations see the bene/uniFB01ts. However, many lack full oversight of the technology, and the majority are at risk of noncompliance when it comes to quickly evolving regulations.

## Our research /uniFB01nds that:

            - ·   Only one in 10 organizations has undergone the preparation needed to comply with GenAI regulations.
            - · 95% of businesses lack a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI.
            - ·   Fewer than one in 10 organizations (7%) is providing a high level of training on GenAI governance and monitoring.
            - ·   Three-quarters of respondents are concerned about data privacy (76%) and security (75%) when GenAI is used in their organization.
            - ·   Only one in 20 organizations (5%) has a reliable system in place to measure bias and privacy risk in LLMs.
            - ·   Seven in 10 organizations are not able to continuously monitor their GenAI systems.

Respondents who say they are best prepared for GenAI regulations are found in China (where almost a /uniFB01fth of respondents, 19% , report that they are fully prepared) followed by Australia (15%) and the US (14%) . The least prepared respondents are in Ireland, where 60% report they are prepared or only slightly prepared, and in Benelux (56%) and Poland (55%) .

Some sectors are ahead of the rest when it comes to developing a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI. Leading the way, telco organizations report that almost one in 10 (9%) have developed such a framework, followed by manufacturing organizations and retail, each at 8% .

## b. Strategic deployment: Translating implementation into measurable bene/uniFB01ts

The ideal GenAI investment offers clear opportunities for ef/uniFB01ciency and a better customer experience, but many organizations report gaps in strategic thinking that are affecting successful rollout:

                        - ·   Nine in 10 senior tech decision makers (93%) admit that they do not fully understand GenAI or its potential impact on business processes.
                        - ·   Almost half (47%) are encountering challenges in transitioning from concept to practical use of GenAI.
                        - ·   More than a third (37%) foresee dif/uniFB01culty proving that GenAI offers a strong ROI or have found this hard to prove.
                        - ·   Fewer than half (45%) of CIOs and around a third (36%) of CTOs consider themselves extremely familiar with GenAI adoption in their organizations.
                        - ·   Four in 10 organizations (39%) do not have a GenAI usage policy in place for their staff.

The countries that we surveyed show a wide range of responses in terms of their GenAI strategy.
