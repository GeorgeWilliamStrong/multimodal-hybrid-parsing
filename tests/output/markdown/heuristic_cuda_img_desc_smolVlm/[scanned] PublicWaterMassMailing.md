Missouri Public Water Systems

November 10, 2015

Dear Public Water System OwnerslOperators:

The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (MSPHL) is in the process of implementing a new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) in its drinking water bacteriology testing laboratory . The OpenELIS (OE) LIMS will provide the laboratory with improved sample management capability, improved data integrity and reduced potential for human data error. In addition; the system will provide improved reporting capabilities; including direct electronic data exchange with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources ' (MDNR) Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS). SDWIS is the computer system MDNR uses to store regulatory water testing data and report testing results to you and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition; the new OE LIMS will provide a web portal that MSPHL clients can use to access their own test results in real time entry

As the MSPHL implements this new computer system; several changes will be made in the way you collect and submit water samples for testing. This letter and information packet will provide you with information to help educate you on these changes.

## NEW SAMPLE BOTTLES:

a This bottle has a shrink wrap seal and two lines to indicate the proper sample volume. Please read the attached "SAMPLE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS" for details on how to use these new bottles. Sample volume MUST be within the two lines on the bottle (100 120 mL) to be acceptable for testing: You may continue to use your old bottles until the MSPHL can ship you new ones. Once you have received the new bottles; please discard or recycle the old bottles:

Beginning in August 2015, the MSPHL began larger sample bottle for water bacterial testing: using

## NEW SAMPLE INFORMATION FORMS:

The traditional sample information "card" that has been used for more than twenty years is replaced by the Environmental Sample Collection Form: An example form is attached. Please read the attached instructions for information on properly completing the new form. being

## Changes to the form include the following:

- 2 The form is printed by the OE LIMS and will be pre-populated with your Public Water Supply ID number, PWS name, address and county . Forms should not be shared with other supplies.
- 1 Form size is expanded to a single 8 % x 11" sheet of paper. The form is no in a triplicate carbon copy format. You may choose to photocopy for your records if you prefer. Note: MDNR does not require a public water system to retain of sample collection forms; however, might utilize them for system inspections. longer copies you

Contract operators will be provided with forms for all the supplies operate. Blank forms will be available for MDNR Regional Office staff use. they

    - 4 Facility ID, Sample Collection Point ID and Location for the sampling site MUST be provided by the collector: This information is available from your MDNR approved PWS sampling plan. MDNR will be providing all public water systems with a current copy of their approved sampling plan: This information is required by SDWIS and is used by MDNR to ensure regulatory compliance requirements have been met. Failure to complete this information on the sample collection form may result in a non-compliance report from MDNR.
    - 3 The form requires all requested information to be printed by the collector: There are no longer check boxes for Sample Type or Repeat Location.
    - 5 A Collector Signature line has been added. The sample collector must sign the form to attest the information provided is accurate to the best of their knowledge.

The MSPHL will begin shipping the new forms to public water systems in late November or early December. Please begin using the new forms December 16,2015. Discard all the old forms ("cards' at that time.

## NEW SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS:

Sample instructions have been revised to include changes to the bottle and sampling form. The instructions include detailed information on how to collect the sample the new bottle; how complete the new sample collection form; how to best samples to the MSPHL the free MSPHL courier system; and how to register for the new MSPHL web portal. A copy of these instructions is attached . using to ship using

## NEW WEB PORTAL FOR RESULTS REPORTS

The OE LIMS provides a web portal that may be used by systems to view and print their test result reports; check status of samples, download sample information into Excel; and receive automated emails when samples are received at the laboratory , and when sample results are ready to be viewed. For information on how to access to this portal, please contact Shondra Johnson; LIMS Administrator at Shondra Johnson@health mo gov or at 573-751-3334. gain

## IMPLEMENTATION DATES:

The MSPHL intends to implement the OpenELIS LIMS on December 1, 2015. There will be a two week period in which laboratory staff will run the new LIMS in conjunction with our current manual, paper-based system to ensure the OE LIMS is operating properly . You may continue to submit samples as you currently the old sample information card, throughout this time. testing do. using

On December 16, 2015, the MSPHL plans to "go-live" with the new OE LIMS. Samples submitted after that date should be submitted on the new Environmental Sample Collection Form. At that time, the MSPHL Test Results Web Portal will also be available to those systems that have becn granted access:

The MSPHL and MDNR understand that there will be a lot of changes to a system that has been in place for many years. The MSPHL is excited about the added benefits from this new system; and we ask for your patience as we implement the OpenELIS LIMS at the Missouri State Public Hcalth Laboratory .

Ifyou have any questions; please contact the MSPHL Environmental Bacteriology Unit at 573-7513334. You may also contact your MDNR Regional Office for additional information on sample collection.

Once again; thank you for your patience and understanding as we implement these changes .

This sample kit and collection method is for public drinking water regulatory compliance and special samples: Only samples collected in bottles supplied by the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (MSPHL) and collected in accordance with these instructions will be accepted for testing. PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY BEFORE COLLECTING SAMPLES.

## Sample Containers:

Sample bottles from the MSPHL contain a chlorine neutralizer that is present in powder or liquid form. The bottles are sterile and ready for use when shipped . Do not rinse the contents from the container and the bottle closed until it is to be filled. keep

## Shrink Seal: Wrap

Remove the seal by pulling down on the red strip and pealing shrink wrap from both the cap and bottle. Discard all shrink wrap. Do not attempt to reseal lid with shrink wrap still attached.

Two Fill Lines:

Eill the bottle until the water sample levelis BETWEEN THE TWO LINES: Place the bottle on a level surface to check the sample level. Samples below the 100 mL (lower) line WILL NOT BE TESTED duc to insufficient sample volume. Samples above the 120 mL (upper) line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to overfilled bottle: Technical protocol and EPA requirements dictate that bottles must have sufficient air space to add reagents and to mix the sample testing

properly .

If the bottle is overfilled past the 120 mL line, pour off water until the sample volume is between the two lines before shipping to MSPHL. MSPHL WILL NOT adjust sample volume once the sample is received at the lab.

## No Paper Label:

There is no longer a label to record sample information on the bottle. DO NOT WRITE ON complete a sample information form for each sample submitted for testing. DATE AND TIME OF SAMPLE COLLECTION and the BOTTLE NUMBER (from sticker on bottle) ARE REQUIRED. A form for each bottle is included in this sample kit.

## Bacteriological Sample Collection Procedures

Assemble all of the sampling supplies.   Before you begin; wash your hands thoroughly before handling supplies   Go to the sampling location(s) specified in your Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) approved sampling site plan: The sample should be taken from a clean; smooth-nosed cold water faucet if possible. Avoid drinking fountains, leaky faucets, hotlcold mixing faucets and frost-proof yard hydrants since it is not practical to sterilize these fixtures.   If possible, remove any aerators, strainers or hoses that are present because may harbor bacteria.  Follow the procedures below when collecting the sample.  Instructions for completing the environmental sampling form are on the following page. they

        - 1 the cold water for about 3 minutes before collecting the sample. This should adequately flush the water line of any debris. Open tap
        - 3 Flush the for an additional 3 minutes with cold water, and then reduce to a gentle flow to about the width of a pencil. Do not change the water flow once you have started sampling as this could dislodge contaminants in the tap tap.
        - 2 Flame-sterilize the andlor chemically disinfect the Do not flamesterilize if is plastic or if acrators are attached. Disinfect tap by thoroughly both the inside and outside of the with a mixture of 50% house-hold bleach (NaOCl) and 50% water. Take extreme care with strong bleach (oxidizing) solutions: tap tap. tap rinsing tap tap
        - Remove the plastic shrink wrap seal by pulling down on the red strip and pealing the shrink wrap from both the cap and bottle. Discard the shrink wrap. Do not attempt to reseal the lid with shrink wrap still attached.
        - 5. cap along edge remove carefully. Do not touch the inside with your fingers. Hold the bottle in one hand and the cap in the other. Do not the cap down or it in a pocket! Also; take care not to contaminate the sterile boule or cap with your fingers or permit the faucet to touch the inside of the bottle. Grasp top and lay put
        - 6 Hold the bottle so that water your hands or the outside of the bottle.
        - Fill out the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) State Public Health Lab (SPHL) Environmental Sample Collection Form waterproof ink. See attached document for instructions on properly completing the sample collection form and for shipping instructions. using
        - 7 Fill the bottle until the water sample level is BETWEEN THE TWO LINES on the bottle (100 120 mI) Preferably, the sample level should be at or just slightly above the 100 ml line. Sample levels below the 100 ml (lower) line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to insufficient sample volume. Sample levels above the 120 ml (upper) line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to overfilled bottle. If the bottle is overfilled, you may off any excess water to the sample level between the two lines. Place the cap on the bottle and screw it down tightly . pour get
        - 9 For single samples; neatly fold the sample collection form into thirds (standard letter fold) roll around the bottle and place in the shipping box. For multiple samples; fold the forms once or more as needed, and place in the shipping box alongside the samples. If needed; use bubble pack or folded paper to fill space: Do not use shredded paper. Seal the box with a single strip of shipping tape and affix the return address label to the of the box. top
