## Understanding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## ntroduction I

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining them with a retrieval system that fetches elevant information from a knowledge base before generating responses. This r approach helps improve accuracy and provides up-to-date information while educing hallucinations. r

## How RAG Works

- 1. Query Processing When a user asks a question, the system processes it to : understand the information needed.
- 2. Retrieval The system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant : documents or passages.
- 3. Augmentation Retrieved information is combined with the original query. :
- 4. Generation The LLM uses both the query and retrieved information to : generate an accurate response.

## Benefits of RAG

- ● mproved accuracy and reliability I
- ● Reduced hallucinations
- ● Access to up-to-date information
- ● Better handling of domain-specific knowledge
- ● Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning
- ● Enhanced transparency and traceability
