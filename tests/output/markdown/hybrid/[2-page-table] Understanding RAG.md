## Understanding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining them with a retrieval system that fetches relevant information from a knowledge base before generating responses. This approach helps improve accuracy and provides up-to-date information while reducing hallucinations.

## How RAG Works

1. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question, the system processes it to understand the information needed.
2. **Retrieval**: The system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant documents or passages.
3. **Augmentation**: Retrieved information is combined with the original query.
4. **Generation**: The LLM uses both the query and retrieved information to generate an accurate response.

## Benefits of RAG

- Improved accuracy and reliability
- Reduced hallucinations
- Access to up-to-date information
- Better handling of domain-specific knowledge
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning
- Enhanced transparency and traceability
