## Foreword: Your journey to a GenAI future

The advent of generative AI (GenAI) promises to revolutionize the landscape of human and business productivity. As you embark on this transformative journey, it is imperative to acknowledge the boundless potential of this new technology, as well as the challenges that accompany such innovation.

This report is based on a new survey of 1,600 organizations across the globe. The respondents are decision makers in GenAI strategy or data analytics in organizations across key sectors. The research assesses their current plans to deploy GenAI, reveals how the technology is integrated into their strategic planning, and explores the specific issues they have encountered along the way. Through meticulous analysis, we examine the pulse of the market, offering insights into the prevailing sentiments around GenAI and the hurdles that organizations face as they integrate the technology into their operations.

From discussions on orchestration, governance, and data privacy to consideration of hallucinations (incorrect or misleading results sometimes generated by large language models (LLMs)) and cost implications, we examine the challenges that companies must overcome and the opportunities GenAI offers for increased productivity and competitive advantage.

## Organizations are reporting early successes

Since the widespread launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, GenAI has emerged as a technology with extraordinary potential. Decision makers recognize that GenAI can drive innovation, new conversational experiences, and operational efficiency.

Our research shows that organizations that embrace GenAI are seeing significant benefits.

<!-- image -->
*Image showing statistics on the benefits of GenAI adoption, including improved employee experience and operational savings.*

However, with increased focus on and investment in GenAI, many organizations are encountering difficulties with implementation. These issues threaten to waste resources, dissuade customers, and even render organizations legally noncompliant. In organizations that have fully implemented GenAI projects, 39% are finding it a challenge to integrate GenAI technology into existing systems, while 34% are struggling with prohibitive costs. These issues are best resolved at an early stage, ideally before GenAI is deployed and significant resources are invested.

Our research shows that while organizations expect to have GenAI successes, they hit stumbling blocks in four areas of implementation:

- Increasing trust in data usage and achieving compliance. Embedding trust in your business outcomes.
- Unlocking value. Translating adoption into measurable benefits.
- Orchestrating GenAI into existing systems and processes. Ensuring that systems and tools do not limit GenAI's potential.
- Finding talent and skills. Identifying the talent who can support your GenAI strategy.

## Strategies for successful GenAI implementation

There are four key elements to achieving success with your GenAI investment:

1. Comprehensive governance
2. Strategic deployment
3. Technological integration
4. Expert guidance

To maximize productivity, GenAI must be seamlessly embedded within business processes and systems. Performance should be reliable, transparent, and ethical, accelerating productivity and improving customer experience, while adding measurable value to stakeholders.

## a. Comprehensive governance: Increasing trust in data usage and achieving regulatory compliance

When a GenAI investment performs reliably, transparently, and ethically, organizations see the benefits. However, many lack full oversight of the technology, and the majority are at risk of noncompliance when it comes to quickly evolving regulations.

Our research finds that:

- Only one in 10 organizations has undergone the preparation needed to comply with GenAI regulations.
- 95% of businesses lack a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI.
- Fewer than one in 10 organizations (7%) is providing a high level of training on GenAI governance and monitoring.
- Three-quarters of respondents are concerned about data privacy (76%) and security (75%) when GenAI is used in their organization.
- Only one in 20 organizations (5%) has a reliable system in place to measure bias and privacy risk in LLMs.
- Seven in 10 organizations are not able to continuously monitor their GenAI systems.

Respondents who say they are best prepared for GenAI regulations are found in China (where almost a fifth of respondents, 19%, report that they are fully prepared), followed by Australia (15%) and the US (14%). The least prepared respondents are in Ireland, where 60% report they are prepared or only slightly prepared, and in Benelux (56%) and Poland (55%).

Some sectors are ahead of the rest when it comes to developing a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI. Leading the way, telco organizations report that almost one in 10 (9%) have developed such a framework, followed by manufacturing organizations and retail, each at 8%.

## Insight 2:

Data management tools are essential to ensure that LLMs are fed the highest quality data and prompts—data that is both auditable and traceable.

These tools can provide user privacy and security, with robust data protection measures, including data minimization, anonymization, and encryption, ensuring that sensitive information remains safeguarded. Furthermore, workflows can be automated for the shortest, most direct route to building or tuning an LLM.

Organizations should refer to governance and compliance policies for an essential framework within which data management tools can be applied.

## b. Strategic deployment: Translating implementation into measurable benefits

The ideal GenAI investment offers clear opportunities for efficiency and a better customer experience, but many organizations report gaps in strategic thinking that are affecting successful rollout:

- Nine in 10 senior tech decision makers (93%) admit that they do not fully understand GenAI or its potential impact on business processes.
- Almost half (47%) are encountering challenges in transitioning from concept to practical use of GenAI.
- More than a third (37%) foresee difficulty proving that GenAI offers a strong ROI or have found this hard to prove.
- Fewer than half (45%) of CIOs and around a third (36%) of CTOs consider themselves extremely familiar with GenAI adoption in their organizations.
- Four in 10 organizations (39%) do not have a GenAI usage policy in place for their staff.

The countries that we surveyed show a wide range of responses in terms of their GenAI strategy. Those who report that they face the most challenges transitioning the technology from concept to practical use include Spain (where 67% of respondents say this is a challenge) and Poland (64%), while the countries who are most confident doing so include Canada (39%), Mexico (40%), and France (40%). Looking at regional trends, 71% of APAC companies are managing their GenAI usage with an internal policy, in contrast to 52% of LATAM respondents.

Respondents in manufacturing (where 61% have a good or complete understanding), life sciences (55%), and telco (55%) report the highest levels of personal understanding where GenAI is concerned. Respondents in the public sector are much less confident in their understanding of GenAI (only 38% say they understand it well or completely).

Nine in 10 (93%) senior tech decision makers admit not fully understanding GenAI and its potential impacts on business processes.

## c. Technological integration: Ensuring that your systems and tools do not limit GenAI's potential

At best, GenAI is seamlessly embedded within an organization's processes and systems. But many companies struggle to integrate the technology with their existing tasks and tools.

Our research finds that:

- Almost half (47%) of decision makers report that they do not have appropriate tools to implement GenAI.
- Four in 10 (41%) are experiencing compatibility issues when they try to combine GenAI with their current systems.
- Half of decision makers (52%) are encountering obstacles in using public and proprietary data sets effectively.
- Over a third (34%) say that the biggest challenge to monitoring GenAI is technological limitations.
- Countries struggling to find the tools and expertise they need to implement GenAI include those in LATAM (57% say they don't have the tools, and 52% don't have the expertise). In contrast, only about a third (36%) of respondents in the APAC region (including only 31% in China) say they don't have the appropriate tools to implement GenAI. Moreover, only 31% in this region say they don't have the internal expertise to do so (21% in China).
- When it comes to monitoring GenAI, some sectors believe they are limited by their access to technology, particularly manufacturing (42%), health care (40%), and retail (40%). Least likely to agree with this are professional services (25%) and telco organizations (28%).

## The APAC region (particularly China) is confident that it has the appropriate tools and expertise to implement and use GenAI.

![Bar chart depicting obstacles encountered in the implementation of GenAI, including utilizing both public and proprietary data sets effectively, absence of appropriate tools, challenges in transitioning generative AI from a conceptual phase to practical use, compatibility issues with current systems, insufficient internal expertise, difficulty proving ROI, prohibitive costs associated with LLMs, and insufficient data to fine-tune LLMs. The data is segmented by regions: North America, LATAM, Northern Europe, South West & Eastern Europe, and APAC.](image)

LLMs alone do not solve business problems. GenAI is nothing more than a feature that can augment your existing processes, but you need tools that enable their integration, governance, and orchestration. And most importantly, you need people that can use tools to ensure the appropriate level of orchestration.

Marinela Profti, Strategic AI Advisor at SAS

## Insight 5:

Make sure that your GenAI software vendors can integrate with existing workflow and decisioning platforms.

GenAI is an ideal contributor to hyper-automation, which facilitates the automation of all feasible tasks within an organization. It excels in summarizing vast amounts of data to support decisioning workflows, enabling real-time interactions aligned with your preferred business processes.

## Insight 6:

Using a decisioning workflow system to infuse GenAI into existing business processes facilitates measurable outcomes.

LLMs can only execute a few tasks of a use case. Organizations still need an end-to-end process that orchestrates the AI life cycle while enhancing the transparency and governance of LLMs.

## d. Expert guidance: Resourcing challenges with scarcity of GenAI skill sets

For many organizations, it really comes down to this: In-house GenAI expertise is lacking. As HR departments encounter a scarcity of suitable hires, organizations worry that they do not have access to the necessary skills to make the most of their GenAI investment.

## Our research finds that:

- Half of organizations (51%) are concerned that they do not have the in-house skills to use the technology effectively.
- Around four in 10 respondents (39%) say they have found insufficient internal expertise to be an obstacle to implementing GenAI.
- North America and the APAC region have slightly less difficulty accessing GenAI skills (44% and 49% report this to be an issue), in contrast with Northern Europe (54%) and the rest of Europe (56%).
- Industries reporting that a lack of internal expertise is a barrier to implementing GenAI include manufacturing (48%), health care (43%), and the public sector (43%). Telco companies (24%) are less affected.

## GenAI adoption rates will continue to grow

## 04

The research reveals that more than half of businesses (54%) have begun to implement GenAI, including 11% that have fully integrated the technology at an enterprise level. The vast majority (86%) of companies are investing in GenAI this year and next. One in five plan to roll out GenAI at the enterprise level, and 72% are undertaking or planning to embark on projects to build their own LLMs.

As you will see in the charts below, there are regional differences in GenAI implementation: China, the UK, the US, Australia, and Germany are ahead of the curve in adoption of the technology. Organizations in the US are further ahead with full implementation. By sector, telco companies have reached a more advanced stage than the rest, followed by retail, insurance, banking, and life sciences. Manufacturing, the public sector, and health care organizations are behind the curve.

## Those in China are most likely to be using GenAI to some extent but full implementation is most common in the US.

![GenAI Usage in China](image2.png)

Organizations are using - or planning to use - GenAI across multiple departments. A massive 86% of respondents have either begun to deploy GenAI across sales departments or are planning to do so.

For marketing, that figure is 85%; for IT 81%; and for finance it's 75%. Even in those departments where GenAI adoption is least likely, the majority are still either using or planning to bring it on board; 59% in HR and 49% in legal departments. A fifth of the workforce (20%) currently use GenAI tools to generate text, images, or video every day.

As organizations adopt GenAI, they seek to understand how to use it safely and ethically. Nearly two-thirds (61%) have a GenAI usage policy in place, indicating that even where governance is patchy, leaders are making efforts to standardize GenAI usage. Almost half (46%) are planning to enlist third-party support to ensure that they make the most of GenAI's potential.

![GenAI Usage by Sector](image3.png)

## Telco, retail, insurance, banking, and life sciences organizations lead in GenAI usage.

## Blueprint for gaining a competitive advantage

It is crucial that GenAI projects are built in a way that not only meet current needs but are also prepared for future growth and innovation.

For a successful GenAI program, you should have a clear strategy for each of the following areas:

- **Accelerated innovation.** Seamlessly integrate GenAI models into decisioning workflows, AI and machine learning applications, and existing business processes by using decisioning flow tools such as intelligent decisioning.
- **Data protection.** Ensure user privacy and security with robust data quality measures—including synthetic data generation, data minimization, anonymization, and encryption—that provide sensitive information safeguards.
- **Trustworthy and explainable results.** Data experts can apply natural language processing techniques to preprocess data, explain the generated output in easily understandable terms, minimize hallucinations, and reduce token costs.
- **Enhanced governance.** Use built-in workflows that validate the entire life cycle of LLMs, from regulatory compliance to model risk management.
