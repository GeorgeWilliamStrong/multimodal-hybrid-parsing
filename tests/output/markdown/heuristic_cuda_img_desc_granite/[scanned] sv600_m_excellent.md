Each year has a corresponding bar that reaches up to a certain height on the vertical axis, which is labeled with numbers ranging from 0 to 100. The height of each bar indicates the value associated with that year.

The bars for 2000 and 2001 are also relatively high, with values of 60 and 50 respectively. The bars for 2002 and 2003 are shorter, with values of 30 and 20 respectively.

The chart is a simple representation of data over a six-year period, with the height of each bar corresponding to a numerical value.
