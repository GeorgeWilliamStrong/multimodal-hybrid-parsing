## Foreword: Your journey to a GenAI future

By Marinela Pro/uniFB01, Strategic AI Advisor at SAS

The advent of generative AI (GenAI) promises to revolutionize the landscape of human and business productivity. As you embark on this transformative journey, it is imperative to acknowledge the boundless potential of this new technology, as well as the challenges that accompany such innovation.

This report is based on a new survey of 1,600 organizations across the globe. The respondents are decision makers in GenAI strategy or data analytics in organizations across key sectors. The research assesses their current plans to deploy GenAI, reveals how the technology is integrated into their strategic planning, and explores the speci/uniFB01c issues they have encountered along the way. Through meticulous analysis, we examine the pulse of the market, offering insights into the prevailing sentiments around GenAI and the hurdles that organizations face as they integrate the technology into their operations.

From discussions on orchestration, governance and data privacy to consideration of hallucinations (incorrect or misleading results sometimes generated by large language models (LLMs)) and cost implications, we examine the challenges that companies must overcome and the opportunities GenAI offers for increased productivity and competitive advantage.

The segments are connected by a white line, and the background is white. The image is designed to convey a positive message about the improvements in employee experience, cost savings, and customer retention.
<!-- end image description -->


However, with increased focus on and investment in GenAI, many organizations are encountering dif/uniFB01culties with implementation. These issues threaten to waste resources, dissuade customers and even render organizations legally noncompliant. In organizations that have fully implemented GenAI projects, 39% are /uniFB01nding it a challenge to integrate GenAI technology into existing systems, while 34% are struggling with prohibitive costs. These issues are best resolved at an early stage, ideally before GenAI is deployed and signi/uniFB01cant resources are invested.

Our research shows that while organizations expect to have GenAI successes, they hit stumbling blocks in four areas of implementation:

    - · Increasing trust in data usage and achieving compliance. Embedding trust in your business outcomes.
    - · Unlocking value. Translating adoption into measurable bene/uniFB01ts.
    - · Orchestrating GenAI into existing systems and processes. Ensuring that systems and tools do not limit GenAI's potential.
    - · Finding talent and skills. Identifying the talent who can support your GenAI strategy.

## a. Comprehensive governance: Increasing trust in data usage and

## achieving regulatory compliance

When a GenAI investment performs reliably, transparently and ethically, organizations see the bene/uniFB01ts. However, many lack full oversight of the technology, and the majority are at risk of noncompliance when it comes to quickly evolving regulations.

## Our research /uniFB01nds that:

            - ·   Only one in 10 organizations has undergone the preparation needed to comply with GenAI regulations.
            - · 95% of businesses lack a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI.
            - ·   Fewer than one in 10 organizations (7%) is providing a high level of training on GenAI governance and monitoring.
            - ·   Three-quarters of respondents are concerned about data privacy (76%) and security (75%) when GenAI is used in their organization.
            - ·   Only one in 20 organizations (5%) has a reliable system in place to measure bias and privacy risk in LLMs.
            - ·   Seven in 10 organizations are not able to continuously monitor their GenAI systems.

Respondents who say they are best prepared for GenAI regulations are found in China (where almost a /uniFB01fth of respondents, 19% , report that they are fully prepared) followed by Australia (15%) and the US (14%) . The least prepared respondents are in Ireland, where 60% report they are prepared or only slightly prepared, and in Benelux (56%) and Poland (55%) .

Some sectors are ahead of the rest when it comes to developing a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI. Leading the way, telco organizations report that almost one in 10 (9%) have developed such a framework, followed by manufacturing organizations and retail, each at 8% .

## Blueprint for gaining a competitive advantage

It is crucial that GenAI projects are built in a way that not only meet current needs but are also prepared for future growth and innovation.

For a successful GenAI program, you should have a clear strategy for each of the following areas:

                                        - · Accelerated innovation. Seamlessly integrate GenAI models into decisioning work/uniFB02ows, AI and machine learning applications, and existing business processes by using decisioning /uniFB02ow tools such as intelligent decisioning.
                                        - · Data protection. Ensure user privacy and security with robust data quality measures - including synthetic data generation, data minimization, anonymization and encryption - that provide sensitive information safeguards.
                                        - · Trustworthy and explainable results. Data experts can apply natural language processing techniques to preprocess data, explain the generated output in easily understandable terms, minimize hallucinations and reduce token costs.
                                        - · Enhanced governance. Use built-in work/uniFB02ows that validate the entire life cycle of LLMs, from regulatory compliance to model risk management.

As organizations continue to experiment with GenAI, real business value will come down to identifying real-world use cases that deliver trusted and scalable value.

As one of the data and AI companies with the longest experience in the /uniFB01eld, SAS is equipped to be the trusted partner that helps organizations con/uniFB01dently succeed in the GenAI journey across different industries, regulatory scenarios and application areas.
