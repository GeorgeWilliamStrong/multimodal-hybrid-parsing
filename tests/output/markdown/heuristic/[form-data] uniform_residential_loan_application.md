This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as 'Borrower' or 'Co-Borrower,' as applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when  the income or assets of a person other than the Borrower (including the Borrower's spouse) will be used as a basis for loan qualification or  the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.
